            <h2>The story</h2>

            <p class="villageois">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                came around to commiserate. They said,</p> <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.</i></blockquote>  <p class="villageois">The farmer said,</p> <blockquote class="agriculteur"> <i>Maybe.</i> </blockquote> 
                <p class="villageois">The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
                it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>  <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
                eighthorses! </i></blockquote> <p class="villageois">The farmer again said,</p> <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>Maybe.</i></blockquote> <br>

            <p class="villageois">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and
                broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p> <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</i></blockquote> <p class="villageois">and the farmer responded,</p> 
                <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>Maybe.</i></blockquote>
               <p class="villageois"> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
                son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>Isn’t that great!</i></blockquote> 
                <p class="villageois">Again, he said,</p>
                <blockquote class="agriculteur"><i>Maybe.</i></blockquote>
            
            

            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
                consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <p>Conclusion<br>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good
            for
            bananas. Let&#39;s not make a big deal out of it...</p>
